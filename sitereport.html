				<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>

				<p>The primary objective is to create a portfolio using HTMl and external CSS that includes five pages: index.html, project.html, contact.html, videodemo.html and sitereport.html using an external CSS. Since the pages on the portfolio website uses some similar designs, i have preferred to use common CSS properties for such. Throughout the development process, i had an opportunity to go through books and websites and practically learn about HTML and CSS properties. Moreover, the website has been designed in such a way that it is user-friendly and responsive in nature.</p> 
				
				<h3>Design Decisions</h3>

				<p> As my personal preference was more inclined to using a black blackground, i decided to design my portfolio accordingly and use the fonts that matches to black background. Although the header section and footer section for all the pages remains same, the main body section varies for all the pages.The header section contains an animated logo, navigation bar and hamburger icon. However, the hamburger icons will be displayed only on the mobile version. Moreover, the footer sections contains social media icons which are animated using animation properties.</p>
				<p>The first page of my webpage is index.html. The main section of my homepage has been divided in two divisons using flex-property, the first one has a brief introduction about me and the other contains my picture. Both of these components are aligned in row-direction. For the mobile version, this page is quite similar except that the navigation bar will be hidden inside the hamburger icon and are aligned in column-direction. Also the main section which is divided into two sections are aligned in column-direction.</p>
				<P>The next page of my portfolio is project.html, where all my projects would be displayed in the future. This page has been designed using a grid layout with a grid gap of 20px. The grid has been divided into three columns using grid-template-columns property. For the mobile version, it is similar except that there is only one column for the project-grid section. </p>
				<P>The third page is contact.html which icludes my contact information, where i have divided the main section into two parts using flexbox property and both these parts are aligned in row-direction. The left section contains my contact details, whereas the right section contains a form which will allow the user to contact me through a message. For the mobile version, the main section parts are aligned in column-direction, so that it is easier to navigate.</p> 
				<P>The fourth page of my portfolio is videodemo.html and contains a video demonstration of my project. For this, i have used an iframe tag and included a video that demonstrates my overall project. The video frame is displayed in the middle of main section. This would be same for the mobile version.</p>
				<P> And the last page of my webpage is sitereport.html. The main section has been divided into four sections and are aligned in column-direction. The first section contains a header and main content of site report, that describes the development of my website, design decisions and references. The other section uses the grid property and the main grid-layout is divided into two columns using grid-template-columns property with a gap of 20px. These column displays screenshots of validation reports of HTML and CSS of all webpages. The last section contains url to my video demonstartion. For the mobile version, only the screenshots-grid layout varies and there is only one columns displaying the screenshots.</p>

				<h3>Module Experience</h3>
				<p>Throughout the module, i got an excellent opportunity to learn in detail about HTML and CSS properties and using them efficiently to create webpages. Also the module empahsize on providing an excellent knowledge for GitHub that would be very useful for both personal and professional development and for collaborative work. Moreover, i was able to improvise my skills on time management and problem solving.
