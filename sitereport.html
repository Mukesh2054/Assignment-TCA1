				<h3>Brief Introduction</h3>

				<p>The primary objective is to create a portfolio using HTMl and external CSS that includes five pages: index.html, project.html, contact.html, videodemo.html and sitereport.html. Since the pages on the portfolio website uses some similar designs, i have preferred to use an external css. Throughout the development process, i had an opportunity to go through books and websites and practically learn about HTML and CSS properties. Moreover, the website has been designed in such a way that it is user-friendly and responsive in nature.</p> 
				
				<h3>Design Decisions</h3>

				<p> As my personal preference was more inclined to using a black blackground, i decided to design my portfolio accordingly and use the fonts that matches to black background. Although the header section for all the pages remains same, the main body section varies for all the pages.The header section contains a logo, navigation bar and hamburger icon. However, the hamburger icons will be displayed only on the mobile version.<br> The main section of my homepage has been divided in two divisons using flex-property, the first one has a brief introduction about me and the other contains my picture. Also the footer section is displayed only on my home page and contains the details of my social media. Another page of my portfolio is project.html, where all my projects would be displayed in the future. This page has been designed using a grid layout. The third page icludes my contact information, where i have divided the main section into two parts using flex property. The left section contains my contact details, whereas the right section contains a form which will allow the user to contact me through a message.<br> The fourth page of my portfolio contains a video demonstration of my project. For this, i have used an iframe tag and included a video that demonstrates my overall project. And the last page of my webpage contains a site report, that describes the development of my website, design decisions, references, screenshots of validation reports and an url to my video demonstartion.</p>
